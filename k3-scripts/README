This directory includes scripts, based on the code in the parent directory,
to identify candidates for the zeta functions of K3 surfaces over finite 
fields. Note that some of these scripts depend on weil_polynomials.pyx in the
parent directory, so that script should be loaded first.

Some of these (in an earlier version) were used to generate data for the paper:

K.S. Kedlaya and A.V. Sutherland, A census of zeta functions of
    quartic K3 surfaces over F_2, LMS Journal of Computing 19
    special issue A (2016), 1-11.

See the directory k3-quartic-f2 for additional data and scripts.

produce-k3f1-lines.sage: Script to generate monic integer polynomials of 
degrees 1, 3, ..., 21 with all roots on the unit circle.

check-k3f1-lines.sage: Script to test the previous script by regenerating this
list using products of cyclotomic polynomials.

produce-k3f2-lines.sage: Script to produce candidate zeta functions of K3
surfaces over F_2. To save space, we only record the transcendental part.

produce-k3f2-full-filtered.sage: Script to reconstructed full zeta functions of
K3 surfaces over F_2 from the transcendental parts, then apply the Artin-Tate
and nonnegativity conditions.

produce-k3f3-lines.sage: Script to produce candidate zeta functions of K3
surfaces over F_3. To save space, we only record the transcendental part.

produce-k3f3-full-filtered.sage: Script to reconstructed full zeta functions of
K3 surfaces over F_3 from the transcendental parts, then apply the Artin-Tate
and nonnegativity conditions.

produce k3-f5-lines.sage: Script to produce candidate zeta functions of K3
surfaces over F_5. To save space, we only record the transcendental part.
